## Project Summaries

### Problem Statement 1: Visualizing Distribution of a Variable
- In this project, I created a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. For example, I analyzed the distribution of ages or genders in a population using Python's matplotlib library.

### Problem Statement 2: Data Cleaning and EDA
- This project involved performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I chose the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and explored relationships between variables, identifying patterns and trends in the data using Python's pandas and seaborn libraries.

### Problem Statement 3: Decision Tree Classifier
- For this project, I built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and implemented the decision tree using Python's scikit-learn library.

### Problem Statement 4: Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Data
- In this project, I analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. I used Python's nltk and matplotlib libraries to perform sentiment analysis and create visualizations.

### Problem Statement 5: Traffic Accident Analysis
- This project involved analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. I visualized accident hotspots and contributing factors using Python's pandas and matplotlibÂ libraries.
